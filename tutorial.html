<p>The RefreshCache snippet refreshes the cache by visiting all site pages that are
published, undeleted, cacheable, and not hidden from menus.</p>

<p>The point is for this program to spend time waiting for the pages so
the site visitors don't have to. They'll see cached pages, which will be
delivered much faster.</p>

<p>RefreshCache is an inelegant, brute-force snippet. It refreshes the cache by
requesting every page with cURL. On many servers, it will produce no
visible output at all until finished -- you'll be looking at a blank screen.</p>

<p>The larger the site, the longer it takes. It's intentionally slow to avoid
stressing the server and to keep from running afoul of bot-blocking software.</p>

<p>On a 100-page site, at broadband speeds, it can take 5-10 minutes to run,
depending on the connection speed and how complex the pages are.
Larger sites can take much longer.</p>

<p>The only settable property is &amp;delay, which sets the number of seconds to sleep
between page requests. The default is 1 second.</p>

<p>To install, paste the code into a snippet called ClearCache. Create a resource
called ClearCache with just the snippet tag: <fixedpre>[[!ClearCache]]</fixedpre>.</p>

<p>**IMPORTANT:** The resource should not be cacheable and the alias should be
refresh-cache -- otherwise the snippet will run forever, launching a new version
of itself every time it hits that page!!!.</p>

<p>Create an empty template with just this tag: <fixedpre>[[*content]]</fixedpre> and be sure to
assign that template to the resource.</p>

<p>To run the snippet, preview the ClearCache resource.</p>
